### Future Implementations

- Please find below a detailed list of future implementations for the website. 

- Discount code functionality
    - A discount function would be a great way to incentivize customers to order and repeat purchases, given out in the newsletter, on order completion and through site participation.
- Cart in Nav Bar showing item numbers
    - It would be good when a user adds an item to the cart, it displays the total quantity in the nav bar next to the cart. It would allow the user to see on any page on the website, how many items are in their cart, without having to go to the cart. 
- Email the user when they register and delivering them unique discount codes.
    - This would enhance the user experience and allow the discount codes to change. Also, it would be good if discount codes had expiry dates or limited uses, to encourage sales and also prevent too many discounts. 

    - When the user completes an order, it would be good User experience, if they receieved an email with their order confirmation. 

- Register a user account using social media
    - User being able to create an account via social media, e.g. facebook, twitter etc. This would be good user experience, as users can create accounts very quickly and also offered marketing oppportunities for Wink. 
- Payment via ApplePay, Pay Pal etc
    - Currently payment is card only. It would be good to offer more methods of payment to the user to improve user experience.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

The project is deployed using Heroku. To deploy the project:

#### **Create the Live Database**

We have been using the sqlite3 database in development, however this is only available for use in development so we will need to create a new external database which can be accessed by Heroku.

1. Go to the [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) dashboard and click the create new instance button on the top right.
2. Name the plan (your project name is a good choice), select tiny turtle plan (this is the free plan) and choose the region that is closest to you then click the review button.
3. Check the details are all correct and then click create instance in the bottom right.
4. Go to the dashboard and select the database just created.
5. Copy the URL (you can click the clipboard icon to copy)

#### **Heroku app setup**

1. From the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), click the new button in the top right corner and select create new app.
2. Give your app a name (this must be unique), select the region that is closest to you and then click the create app button bottom left.
3. Open the settings tab and create a new config var of `DATABASE_URL` and paste the database URL you copied from elephantSQL into the value (the value should not have quotation marks around it).

#### **Preparation for deployment in Codeanywhere**

1. Install dj_database_url and psycopg2 (they are both needed for connecting to the external database you've just set up):

```bash
pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2
```

2. Update your requirements.txt file with the packages just installed:

```bash
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

3. In settings.py underneath import os, add `import dj_database_url`

4. Find the section for DATABASES and comment out the code. Add the following code below the commented out database block, and use the URL copied from elephantSQL for the value:

(NOTE! don't delete the original section, as this is a temporary step whilst we connect the external database. Make sure you don't push this value to GitHub - this value should not be saved to GitHub, it will be added to the Heroku config vars in a later step, this is temporary to allow us to migrate our models to the external database)

```python
DATABASES = {
'default': dj_database_url.parse('paste-elephantsql-db-url-here')
}
```

5. In the terminal, run the show migrations command to confirm connection to the external database:

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

6. If you have connected the database correctly you will see a list of migrations that are unchecked. You can now run migrations to migrate the models to the new database:

```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
```

7. Create a superuser for the new database. Input a username, email and password when directed.

```bash
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

8. You should now be able to go to the browser tab on the left of the page in elephantsql, click the table queries button and see the user you've just created by selecting the auth_user table.
9. We can now add an if/else statement for the databases in settings.py, so we use the development database while in development (the code we commented out) - and the external database on the live site (note the change where the db URL was is now a variable we will use in Heroku):

```python
if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
DATABASES = {
'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
}
else:
DATABASES = {
'default': {
'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3')
}
}
```

10. Install gunicorn which will act as our webserver and freeze this to the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip3 install gunicorn
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

11. Create a `Procfile` in the root directory. This tells Heroku to create a web dyno which runs gunicorn and serves our django app. Add the following to the file (making sure not to leave any blank lines underneath):

```Procfile
web: gunicorn seaside_sewing.wsgi:application
```

12. Log into the Heroku CLI in the terminal and then run the following command to disable collectstatic. This command tells Heroku not to collect static files when we deploy:

```bash
heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app heroku-app-name-here
```

13. We will also need to add the Heroku app and localhost (which will allow GitPod to still work) to ALLOWED_HOSTS = [] in settings.py:

```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['{heroku deployed site URL here}', 'localhost' ]
```

14. Save, add, commit and push the changes to GitHub. You can then also initialize the Heroku git remote in the terminal and push to Heroku with:

```bash
heroku git:remote -a {app name here}
git push heroku main
```

15. You should now be able to see the deployed site (without any static files as we haven't set these up yet).

16. To enable automatic deploys on Heroku, go to the deploy tab and click the connect to GitHub button in the deployment method section. Search for the projects repository and then click connect. Click enable automatic deploys at the bottom of the page.

Heroku was used to deploy the live website. The instruction to achieve this are below:

1. Log in to Heroku.
2. Find the app from this project and open - wink
3. Click on deploy.
4. Find 'App connected to Github' and link to Github account.
5. Search for repository and link - caninreason/wink
6. Find Manual Deploy and click Deploy Branch.
7. Click on Open App at the top right of the screen to view the live site.

## Testing

- Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

### Full Testing

- To fully test the website I performed the following tests using a number of different browsers, as well as testing on a Windows 10 desktop and laptop, also a number of android phones were used during testing.

- I also went through each page using google chrome developer tools to ensure that they responsive on all different screen sizes.

### Cart

 - All items can be added to the cart for the item detail page.  
 - In the Cart
    - item quantities can be updated using the update quantity button
    - items can be removed using the remove button
    - The user can proceed to the checkout and all items from the cart will be transfereed succesfully to the checkout. 

### Checkout

- All fields allow input
- Once all fields are completed, the order can be submited to Stripe. 

 - The checkout form has validation to make sure all the boxes are filled in, before the form is submited. The form needs validation on what is inputted in each box, as currently there is no validation on what can be entered into the fields. 
 ![]()
- All fields on the checkout need to be complete before the order can be submitted.
